## Phase 2: Database Performance Optimization - COMPLETE

### Strategic Index Implementation
```sql
-- 22 Performance Indexes Added:

-- Product Performance Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_products_category_id ON products(category_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_status ON products(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_stock ON products(stock_quantity);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_featured ON products(featured);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_created_at ON products(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_price ON products(price);

-- Cart Performance Indexes  
CREATE INDEX idx_cart_items_user_id ON cart_items(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_cart_items_session_id ON cart_items(session_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_cart_items_product_id ON cart_items(product_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_cart_items_user_product ON cart_items(user_id, product_id);

-- Order Performance Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status ON orders(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_created_at ON orders(created_at);

-- Wishlist Performance Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_wishlist_user_product ON wishlist(user_id, product_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_wishlist_user_id ON wishlist(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_wishlist_product_id ON wishlist(product_id);

-- User Performance Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email_lower ON users(LOWER(email));
CREATE INDEX idx_users_role ON users(role);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_is_admin ON users(is_admin);

-- Activity Logs Performance Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_activity_logs_user_id ON activity_logs(user_id);
