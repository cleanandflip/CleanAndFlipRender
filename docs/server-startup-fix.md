# Server Startup Fix - Clean & Flip

## Issues Identified:
1. Variable naming conflict: `server` declared twice in server/index.ts
2. Missing dependencies: vite and other packages
3. TypeScript compilation errors throughout codebase
4. Frontend not properly served - showing placeholder API page

## Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ Renamed duplicate `server` variable to `httpServer`
2. ✅ Installing missing packages (vite, winston, etc.)
3. ⏳ TypeScript configuration updated (ES2015 lib added)
4. ⏳ Frontend serving setup

## Expected Resolution:
- Server should start without variable conflicts
- All dependencies available
- React frontend properly served instead of placeholder
- Database working with 100GB production setup

## Next Steps:
1. Verify server starts successfully
2. Test frontend loads properly
3. Verify all APIs functional
4. Clean up any remaining TypeScript errors
