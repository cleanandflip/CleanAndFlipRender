# 🎯 Smart Database Configuration

## ✅ INTELLIGENT ENVIRONMENT DETECTION

Your database now **automatically** selects the right database based on where it's running:

### 🏠 **Localhost/Development**
**When you run:** `npm run dev` (in Replit workspace)
- **Detects:** localhost, Replit workspace environment
- **Uses:** Development database (`ep-lingering-flower`)
- **Perfect for:** Your development work with test data

### 🚀 **Production Deployment**
**When deployed:** Via Replit Deploy button
- **Detects:** `REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT=true` or `NODE_ENV=production`
- **Uses:** Production database (`ep-muddy-moon`)
- **Perfect for:** Live customers with your 13 products

## 🔍 **Detection Methods (In Priority Order)**

1. **Replit Deployment Flag** → Production
2. **NODE_ENV=production** → Production  
3. **Localhost Detection** → Development
4. **Replit Workspace** → Development
5. **Default** → Development (safest)

## 🛡️ **Built-in Safety Features**

- ✅ **Production Protection**: Blocks development database in production
- ✅ **Development Warning**: Warns if dev uses production database
- ✅ **Automatic Fallback**: Uses `DATABASE_URL` if `DATABASE_URL_PROD` missing
- ✅ **Clear Logging**: Shows which database and why

## 📋 **What You See In Logs**

### Development (localhost):
```
[DB] Environment detected via localhost → DEVELOPMENT
[DB] ✅ Using DEVELOPMENT database (localhost environment)
[SESSION] Using database: development
```

### Production (deployment):
```
[DB] Environment detected via REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT=true → PRODUCTION
[DB] ✅ Using PRODUCTION database (muddy-moon)
[SESSION] Using database: production
```

## 🎉 **Zero Configuration Required**

**Just deploy!** The system will:
1. Detect it's a production deployment
2. Use your production database with all 13 products
3. Maintain complete separation from development data

No need to manually configure environment variables - it works automatically based on where it's running.

## 🔄 **Database Separation Maintained**

- **Development**: Your workspace keeps using development data
- **Production**: Deployment automatically uses production data
- **Sessions**: Both environments use their respective databases
- **Safety**: Cross-contamination prevented by security checks
