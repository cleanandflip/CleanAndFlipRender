# Replit Database Setup Required

## Current Issue
The previous database creation still points to an external Neon database (`ep-polished-fog-afk9khik`). We need a true Replit-managed database.

## What's Needed
You need to create a Replit Database through the Replit interface:

1. **Click "Ask Agent to set up a database"** - This will create a proper Replit-managed PostgreSQL database
2. **Or click "Create a database manually"** - Then select PostgreSQL

## Why Replit Database is Better
- **Unified Management**: Everything in one Replit environment
- **Automatic Backups**: Point-in-time restore capabilities
- **Usage-Based Billing**: Only pay for what you use
- **No External Dependencies**: Eliminates connection issues
- **Integrated Tooling**: Access through Replit's database tools

## Expected Result
After creating the Replit database, you should get:
- `DATABASE_URL` that points to a Replit-managed PostgreSQL instance
- Automatic environment variable injection
- Integrated database management tools

## Current Status
❌ External Neon database: `ep-polished-fog-afk9khik` (not ideal)
✅ Schema ready: All 21 tables defined and can be migrated
✅ Application ready: Code supports unified database configuration

Once you create the Replit database, I can immediately migrate the schema and configure your application to use it for both development and production environments.
