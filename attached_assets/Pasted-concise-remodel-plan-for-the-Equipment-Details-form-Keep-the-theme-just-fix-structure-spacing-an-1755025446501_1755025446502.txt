concise remodel plan for the Equipment Details form. Keep the theme; just fix structure, spacing, and flow.

Layout & Flow (desktop → mobile stacks)
Grid container

max-w-3xl mx-auto p-8

grid grid-cols-12 gap-x-6 gap-y-5 (mobile: grid-cols-1 gap-y-5)

Field order & column spans

Row 1:

Equipment Name → col-span-6

Brand → col-span-6

Row 2:

Category → col-span-6

Condition → col-span-6

Row 3:

Weight (lbs) (with unit suffix) → col-span-6

Your Asking Price (with $ prefix) → col-span-6

Row 4:

Description → col-span-12 (rows 5–6)

Helper copy:

Short price note under Price (text-xs).

Long guidance under Description (text-xs).

Remove any duplicated/global helper lines.

Mobile

Use the same field order, each col-span-12.

Keep gap-y-5 so fields don’t crowd.

Field Components (unify look)
Use shared Input / Dropdown / Textarea only.

Height: h-11 for Inputs & Dropdown triggers (match).

Radius/border: same across all.

Labels: text-sm font-medium mb-2 (no extra margins elsewhere).

Placeholders: rely on global --placeholder-opacity (already added).

Adornments:

Price → left $ prefix.

Weight → right lbs suffix.
(Use input adornment slot; no inline text nodes.)

Visual Noise Reduction
Remove extra borders/boxes between fields—let gap do the work.

Keep section title “Equipment Details” then a single subtle divider (my-4) if needed—no nested frames.

Dropdown trigger uses same rest/hover/focus as inputs (no darker rectangle).

Spacing & Copy
Label → control (mt-2).

Helper/Error (mt-1 text-xs).

Trim placeholder text:

Name: “e.g. Olympic Barbell 45lb”

Brand: “Search or select a brand…”

Weight: “Total weight in pounds”

Price: “0.00” (currency formatting handled on blur)

Description: “Condition, modifications, included accessories…”

Behavior & A11y
Numeric inputs: inputMode="decimal" (Price), inputMode="numeric" (Weight); validate on blur.

Error state: red ring + message directly under control; aria-invalid + aria-describedby.

Dropdown menus: render via portal to document.body, z-[60], sideOffset=8, width = trigger width.

Reduced motion respected (keep subtle hover only).

Implementation Checklist (do now)
 Replace current wrapper with grid grid-cols-12 gap-x-6 gap-y-5 and apply spans above.

 Convert Price/Weight to inputs with adornments (prefix $, suffix lbs).

 Ensure all controls use h-11, same radius/border/focus.

 Move price note under Price; keep long guidance only under Description.

 Remove any extra card-within-card boxes; keep one section card only.

 Verify dropdown panel sits above card and matches trigger width.

 Mobile: confirm clean stacking and consistent gaps.

If you want, I can provide a tiny JSX snippet showing just the grid + column spans so the dev can paste it and slot your components in.
