Here's a prompt for Replit to make these changes:

Remove Username Field - Use Email for Authentication
I need to simplify the authentication system by removing usernames entirely. Users should sign in with their email address only.
Required Changes:
1. Update Sign-Up Form (remove username field):

Remove the username input field from the registration form
Keep: First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Password
Email will be the unique identifier for login

2. Update Sign-In Form:

Change the sign-in form to ask for Email (not username)
Update placeholder text to "Email" instead of "Username"
Keep password field as is

3. Database Schema Updates:
Find and update all database tables/schemas:
sql-- If username column exists, remove it:
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS username;

-- Make sure email is unique and not null:
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN email SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT users_email_unique UNIQUE (email);
4. Update Code Files:
In server/storage.ts:

Remove all references to username
Change getUserByUsername to getUserByEmail
Update all queries to use email instead of username
Remove username from INSERT statements
Remove username from SELECT statements

In server/auth.ts:

Update login logic to authenticate with email
Remove username from registration process
Update any validation that checks for username

In frontend auth components:

Remove username field from forms
Update form validation schemas
Change any "username" labels to "email"
Update API calls to send email instead of username

In type definitions:

Remove username: string from User type
Update any interfaces that include username

5. Search and Replace:
Search entire codebase for these terms and update accordingly:

username → remove or replace with email
getUserByUsername → getUserByEmail
Username → Email (in UI labels)

6. Update Validation:

Remove username validation rules
Ensure email validation is in place
Email should be required and unique

Example of updated sign-in:
javascript// Old way:
const user = await getUserByUsername(username);

// New way:
const user = await getUserByEmail(email);
Please make these changes throughout the entire application to use email-based authentication instead of username-based authentication.
