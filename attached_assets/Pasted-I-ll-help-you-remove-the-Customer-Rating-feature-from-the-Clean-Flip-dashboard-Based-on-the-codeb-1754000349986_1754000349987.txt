I'll help you remove the Customer Rating feature from the Clean & Flip dashboard. Based on the codebase audit, here are the instructions to remove all traces of it:
Instructions to Remove Customer Rating
1. Remove from Dashboard Component
The Customer Rating is displayed on the dashboard. You'll need to:

Open client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx (or similar dashboard file)
Look for the stats/metrics section that displays the four cards (Orders, Submissions, Wishlist, Customer Rating)
Remove the Customer Rating card component entirely

2. Search and Remove All References
Run a global search in your codebase for:

"Customer Rating"
"rating" (case-insensitive)
4.9 (if it's hardcoded)
Any star icon imports related to ratings

3. Likely Files to Check
Based on the architecture, check these locations:
client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
client/src/components/dashboard/
client/src/components/common/
4. Database Schema
If there's a ratings table or column in the database:

Check shared/schema.ts for any rating-related fields
Remove any rating columns from the database schema
Create a migration if needed

5. API Endpoints
Remove any rating-related endpoints:

Check server/routes.ts for rating endpoints
Remove any /api/ratings or similar routes

6. Clean Up Imports
After removing the component, ensure you:

Remove unused imports (star icons, rating components)
Remove any rating-related types or interfaces

Quick Fix for Immediate Removal:
If you want to quickly hide it while you clean up properly, you can:

Find the Customer Rating card in the dashboard
Comment it out or add display: none to its CSS class
Adjust the grid layout if needed (change from 4 columns to 3)

The component structure likely looks something like this in your dashboard:
tsx<div className="grid grid-cols-4 gap-4">
  {/* Orders Card */}
  {/* Submissions Card */}
  {/* Wishlist Card */}
  {/* Customer Rating Card - REMOVE THIS */}
</div>
Change the grid to 3 columns after removal:
tsx<div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
This should completely remove the Customer Rating feature from your application.
