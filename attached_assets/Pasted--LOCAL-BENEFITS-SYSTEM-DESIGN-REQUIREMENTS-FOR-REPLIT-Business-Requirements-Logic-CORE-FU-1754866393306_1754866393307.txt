ðŸŽ¯ LOCAL BENEFITS SYSTEM - DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR REPLIT
Business Requirements & Logic
ðŸ“Œ CORE FUNCTIONALITY
WHAT WE NEED:
1. System that shows FREE pickup when customers SELL to us (local only)
2. System that shows FREE delivery when customers BUY from us (local only)
3. Non-local customers should see these benefits exist but understand they don't qualify
4. Must be elegant, minimal, and professional - no clutter

WHO QUALIFIES:
- ZIP codes starting with 287 or 288 (Asheville, NC area)
- Stored as is_local_customer in database
- Determined during onboarding when user enters address

VISUAL HIERARCHY:
- Information should be discoverable but not intrusive
- Local customers: Subtle positive reinforcement (they qualify)
- Non-local customers: Clear but not disappointing (they see what exists)

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIT AI
ðŸ“Œ DESIGN BRIEF
Create a beautiful, minimal local benefits indication system with these requirements:
1. HEADER INDICATOR
REQUIREMENT:
- Small, elegant indicator that shows after user logs in
- Should sit cleanly under main navigation
- Local customers: See a subtle indicator they have free delivery/pickup
- Non-local: See nothing OR very subtle note about their shipping status

DESIGN DIRECTION:
- Think Apple Store website - ultra clean
- Maybe just a thin line with small text
- Could use a subtle animation (pulse, glow) for local customers
- Consider using icons sparingly - only if they enhance clarity
2. PRODUCT BROWSING
REQUIREMENT:
- Products should indicate free delivery for local customers
- Must not clutter the product cards
- Non-local customers should see shipping will be added

DESIGN DIRECTION:
- Perhaps a small badge or text line
- Could be revealed on hover to keep cards clean
- Use color very sparingly - maybe just one accent
- Think Net-a-Porter or high-end e-commerce
3. PRODUCT DETAIL PAGE
REQUIREMENT:
- Clear delivery/shipping information
- Local customers immediately see FREE delivery
- Non-local see standard shipping options
- Must feel integrated, not like an afterthought

DESIGN DIRECTION:
- Could be part of the "Add to Cart" area
- Or a subtle info box near price
- Use whitespace effectively
- Consider using subtle backgrounds or borders
4. SHOPPING CART
REQUIREMENT:
- Show delivery cost (FREE for local, TBD for others)
- Don't make non-local customers feel bad
- Clear but not overwhelming

DESIGN DIRECTION:
- Integrate into order summary naturally
- Maybe use different text weight or subtle color
- Consider a small informational tooltip
5. CHECKOUT FLOW
REQUIREMENT:
- Local customers should have FREE delivery pre-selected
- Must be impossible to miss that delivery is free
- Non-local see standard shipping options
- Smooth, professional checkout experience

DESIGN DIRECTION:
- Pre-selected radio button for local customers
- Maybe highlight the free option subtly
- Consider using a check mark or other positive indicator
- Think Shopify or Stripe checkout - clean and trustworthy
6. SELLING EQUIPMENT PAGE
REQUIREMENT:
- Local customers must know we pickup for FREE
- Should encourage them to sell to us
- Non-local should see alternative options

DESIGN DIRECTION:
- Could be a benefit highlight near the form
- Or integrated into the submission flow
- Keep it confidence-inspiring
- Think about trust signals

DESIGN INSPIRATION DIRECTIVE

SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIT
Dear Replit AI,

Please design and implement a beautiful, minimal system for indicating local delivery/pickup benefits throughout the website. 

The user is a fitness equipment resale business in Asheville, NC that offers:
1. FREE pickup when local customers sell equipment to them
2. FREE delivery when local customers buy from them

Local customers are those in ZIP codes 287xx-288xx.

Make it:
- Subtle and elegant (think Apple, Everlane, high-end e-commerce)
- Clear but not overwhelming
- Professional and trustworthy
- Mobile-responsive
- Accessible

Avoid:
- Bright, harsh colors
- Large banners or pop-ups
- Making non-local customers feel excluded
- Cluttering the clean design
- Over-explaining (keep text minimal)

Use your design expertise to create something beautiful that enhances rather than disrupts the shopping experience. Focus on subtle visual cues, thoughtful typography, and strategic placement.

The goal is for local customers to feel special without non-local customers feeling penalized.
This gives Replit the requirements and creative freedom to design something beautiful!
