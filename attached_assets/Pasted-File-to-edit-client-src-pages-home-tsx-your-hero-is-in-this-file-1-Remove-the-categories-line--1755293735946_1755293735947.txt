File to edit

client/src/pages/home.tsx (your hero is in this file)

1) Remove the categories line

Find the paragraph that renders:

Dumbbells • Kettlebells • Plates • Barbells • More


It likely looks like:

<p className="text-lg md:text-xl max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-8 md:mt-10 font-semibold">
  Dumbbells • Kettlebells • Plates • Barbells • More
</p>


Delete that entire <p> block (or comment it out).

2) Make the small text look premium (spacing + micro-typography only)

Find the three-line hero block (H1, subhead, location) and replace ONLY the classNames (keep text exactly):

<h1 className="text-5xl md:text-7xl font-extrabold tracking-tight leading-[1.05] max-w-3xl mx-auto">
  Local Weights, Fair Prices
</h1>

<p className="mt-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-white/80">
  Buy & sell with fast pickup & delivery
</p>

<p className="mt-5">
  <span className="inline-flex items-center rounded-full border border-white/10 bg-white/5 px-3 py-1 text-xs md:text-sm text-white/70 tracking-wide">
    Based in Asheville, NC
  </span>
</p>


What changed (why it looks better):

Subhead uses leading-relaxed and text-white/80 for softer contrast and easier scan.

Location line becomes a subtle pill (tiny border + soft background) so it reads as metadata, not body copy.

Spacing nudged to mt-4 (H1 → subhead) and mt-5 (subhead → location) for breathable rhythm.

H1 keeps impact but with slightly tighter line-height leading-[1.05] and a safe max-w-3xl.

3) (Optional) Give the hero a touch more breathing room

If your hero <section> wrapper still feels tight, bump its padding only (no layout change):

Find:

<section className="flex items-center justify-center py-16 md:py-24 px-4 md:px-6">


Ensure it uses at least:

<section className="flex items-center justify-center py-20 md:py-28 px-4 md:px-6">

Quick acceptance checklist

The category line is gone.

Subhead is easier to read (softer color, better line-height).

“Based in Asheville, NC” appears as a small rounded pill, not a third headline.

Overall spacing around the hero text feels airy, not cramped.
