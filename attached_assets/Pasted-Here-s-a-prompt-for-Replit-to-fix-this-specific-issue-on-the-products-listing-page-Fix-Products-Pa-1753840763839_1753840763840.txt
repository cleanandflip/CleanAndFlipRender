Here's a prompt for Replit to fix this specific issue on the products listing page:

Fix Products Page - Still Sending [object Object] Instead of Proper API Call
The /products page is trying to load a specific product with [object Object] which shouldn't happen on the listing page.
Root Cause Analysis:
The products listing page is trying to fetch a single product detail, which is wrong. It should be fetching a list of products.
Find and Fix in the Products Page Component:
1. Check the Products Listing Page (/products route):
Look for the component that renders when visiting /products:
javascript// WRONG - Products listing shouldn't fetch a single product
useEffect(() => {
  fetch(`/api/products/${someObject}`) // This is causing [object Object]
}, []);

// CORRECT - Products listing should fetch all products
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api/products') // No ID needed for listing
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => setProducts(data));
}, []);
2. Check for Accidental Product Detail Fetching:
The products page might be accidentally trying to load a product detail:
javascript// Look for code like this in the products listing component:
const { id } = useParams(); // This might be undefined or an object
const [product, setProduct] = useState();

useEffect(() => {
  // This shouldn't be in the products listing page
  if (id) {
    fetch(`/api/products/${id}`) // id might be an object
  }
}, [id]);

// REMOVE any single product fetching from the listing page
3. Check the Route Configuration:
Make sure routes are set up correctly:
javascript// Routes should be:
<Route path="/products" element={<ProductsListing />} /> // List page
<Route path="/products/:id" element={<ProductDetail />} /> // Detail page

// NOT:
<Route path="/products/:product" element={<ProductsListing />} /> // Wrong
4. Fix the Products Listing Component:
The products listing page should look like:
javascript// ProductsListing.jsx or similar
function ProductsListing() {
  const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch ALL products, not a single product
    fetch('/api/products')
      .then(res => {
        if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load products');
        return res.json();
      })
      .then(data => {
        setProducts(data);
        setLoading(false);
      })
      .catch(err => {
        setError(err.message);
        setLoading(false);
      });
  }, []); // Empty dependency array

  // Render products list...
}
5. Check for Mixed Up Components:
Make sure the products listing isn't importing or using product detail logic:
javascript// WRONG - Don't mix listing and detail logic
import { useProductDetail } from './hooks'; // Remove from listing page

// CORRECT - Keep them separate
import { useProductsList } from './hooks'; // For listing page
6. Debug Log to Find the Issue:
Add this at the top of your products listing component:
javascriptconsole.log('Products page mounted');
console.log('Current URL:', window.location.pathname);
console.log('Route params:', useParams()); // Should be empty on /products
7. Check API Endpoints:
Make sure your API has these endpoints:

GET /api/products - Returns array of all products
GET /api/products/:id - Returns single product by ID

8. Quick Fix While Debugging:
In the products page, add a guard:
javascriptuseEffect(() => {
  // Don't try to fetch a single product on the listing page
  if (window.location.pathname === '/products') {
    // Fetch all products
    fetch('/api/products')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(setProducts);
  }
}, []);
The issue is that the /products listing page is trying to fetch a specific product instead of the products list. Find where this is happening and remove any single product fetching logic from the listing page.
