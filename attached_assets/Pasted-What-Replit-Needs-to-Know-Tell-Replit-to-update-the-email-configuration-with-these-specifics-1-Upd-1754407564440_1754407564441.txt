What Replit Needs to Know
Tell Replit to update the email configuration with these specifics:
1. Update Environment Variables
envRESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx  # Your actual API key
EMAIL_DOMAIN=cleanandflip.com
FRONTEND_URL=https://cleanandflip.com

# Email addresses for sending (not receiving)
EMAIL_FROM_ADMIN=Clean & Flip Admin <admin@cleanandflip.com>
EMAIL_FROM_SUPPORT=Clean & Flip Support <support@cleanandflip.com>
EMAIL_FROM_ORDERS=Clean & Flip Orders <orders@cleanandflip.com>

# Where to receive admin notifications (your actual inbox)
ADMIN_EMAIL=cleanandflipyt@gmail.com  # Or your outlook email
2. Fix the Activity Logs Error
Have Replit update the password reset service to fix the database error:
typescript// In /server/services/password-reset.service.ts
private static async logSecurityEvent(
  userId: number, 
  event: string, 
  ipAddress: string
) {
  try {
    // Make sure the column names match your schema
    await db.insert(activityLogs).values({
      userId: userId,
      action: event,  // Ensure this column exists
      type: 'security',  // Add if your schema has this
      metadata: { 
        ipAddress,
        event,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      },
      createdAt: new Date()
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error logging security event:', error);
    // Don't throw - logging shouldn't break the main flow
  }
}
3. Test Email Sending
Now that DNS is verified, test the email system:
bash# Quick test endpoint
curl -X POST https://cleanandflip.com/api/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "cleanandflipyt@gmail.com"}'
4. Important Notes for Email Delivery
Since you're using Gmail to receive test emails:

Check Spam Folder - First few emails might go to spam
Add to Contacts - Add these emails to your contacts:

admin@cleanandflip.com
support@cleanandflip.com
orders@cleanandflip.com


Whitelist in Gmail - Create a filter to never send to spam

5. Production Checklist
Tell Replit to ensure:

 Remove any test email endpoints before going live
 Set up email rate limiting (max 100/hour for password resets)
 Add email templates for all transaction types
 Implement unsubscribe links in marketing emails
 Add email bounce handling
 Set up email analytics tracking

Your DNS setup is correct! The password reset emails should now work. Try the forgot password flow again, and check both your inbox and spam folder. The email should arrive within 1-2 minutes.
