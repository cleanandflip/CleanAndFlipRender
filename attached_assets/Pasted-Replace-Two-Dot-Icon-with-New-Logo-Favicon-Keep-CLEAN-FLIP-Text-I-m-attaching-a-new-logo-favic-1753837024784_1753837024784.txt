Replace Two-Dot Icon with New Logo/Favicon - Keep "CLEAN & FLIP" Text
I'm attaching a new logo/favicon image. Please replace ONLY the two-dot icon (●●) throughout the site, but KEEP the "CLEAN & FLIP" text everywhere.
1. Navigation Bar (All Pages):
Current: ●● CLEAN & FLIP
Change to: [NEW LOGO] CLEAN & FLIP
jsx// Update the navigation component
<nav className="floating-nav">
  <Link href="/" className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <img 
      src="/path-to-new-logo" 
      alt="Clean & Flip Logo" 
      className="h-6 w-6"  // Small icon size
    />
    <span className="font-bold text-white">CLEAN & FLIP</span>
  </Link>
  {/* Rest of nav items: Shop, Sell, About, Contact */}
</nav>
2. Auth Pages - SPECIAL CASE:
Remove this entire section (the oval with redundant branding):

The two-dot logo (●●)
The text "CLEAN & FLIP"
"JOIN THE MARKETPLACE" heading
"Turn unused gear into cash..." tagline
The entire rounded/oval container

Replace with JUST the logo/favicon:
jsx// Above the auth form, add only:
<div className="flex justify-center mb-8">
  <img 
    src="/path-to-new-logo" 
    alt="Clean & Flip" 
    className="h-24 w-24"  // Larger standalone size
  />
</div>

// Then the form starts (Sign In or Create Account)
3. Throughout the Website:
Search for ALL instances of the two-dot icon (●●) and replace with the new logo image, but ALWAYS keep the "CLEAN & FLIP" text:
Footer example:
jsx// If footer has: ●● CLEAN & FLIP
// Change to:
<div className="flex items-center gap-2">
  <img src="/path-to-new-logo" className="h-5 w-5" />
  <span>CLEAN & FLIP</span>
</div>
Any headers/titles:
jsx// Wherever you see: ●● CLEAN & FLIP
// It becomes: [logo image] CLEAN & FLIP
4. What NOT to Change:

Don't remove "CLEAN & FLIP" text from anywhere (except the auth page redundant section)
Don't change the text styling or font
Don't change navigation layout
Keep all text exactly as is

5. Favicon Updates:
html<!-- Update browser tab icon -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/path-to-new-logo" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/path-to-new-logo" />
6. Summary of Changes:
Navigation Bar: ●● CLEAN & FLIP → [LOGO] CLEAN & FLIP
Auth Pages: Remove entire oval section → Just show logo image centered
Everywhere Else: ●● → [LOGO] (but keep "CLEAN & FLIP" text)
Key Points:

The two-dot icon (●●) is replaced with the new logo image everywhere
"CLEAN & FLIP" text stays everywhere EXCEPT the redundant auth section
On auth pages, remove the whole redundant branding section and show ONLY the logo image
Maintain consistent spacing between logo and text throughout

Please implement these specific changes using the logo/favicon image I'm providing.
