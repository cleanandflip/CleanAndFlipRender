Complete Text Visibility Overhaul Instructions for Replit
1. ALL LABELS - Make them POP
Change every form label to:
text-white text-lg font-semibold
This includes:

"Equipment Name *"
"Brand"
"Condition *"
"Weight (lbs)"
"Your Asking Price (Optional)"
"Description"
"PHOTOS"

2. PLACEHOLDER TEXT - Clearly Visible
Update all placeholder text to:
placeholder:text-gray-300 placeholder:text-base
For:

"e.g. Olympic Barbell 45lb"
"Search or select a brand..."
"Total weight in pounds"
"Tell us about the equipment - age, usage, any wear or damage..."

3. HELPER/DESCRIPTIVE TEXT - Bright & Readable
Change all gray helper text to:
text-gray-200 text-base leading-relaxed
This includes:

"This helps us make a fair offer, but we'll evaluate based on condition and market value."
"Upload clear photos showing the equipment from multiple angles..."
"Drag and drop photos here, or click to select"
The bullet points about photos

4. INPUT TEXT - Pure White
Ensure ALL user-typed text appears as:
text-white text-lg
5. SECTION HEADERS - Extra Bold
Make section headers stand out:
text-white text-2xl font-bold uppercase tracking-wide mb-6
For: "EQUIPMENT DETAILS" and "PHOTOS"
6. SPECIAL ELEMENTS

Required asterisks (*): Change to text-red-400 or text-yellow-400 for visibility
Dollar sign ($): Make it text-white text-lg
Upload icon: Make it text-white or text-gray-300
"Choose Files" button: Style as bg-gray-700 text-white border-2 border-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-600

7. COMPLETE INPUT FIELD STYLING
Replace all input/select/textarea styling with:
w-full px-4 py-3 text-white text-lg bg-gray-800/50 
border-2 border-gray-400 rounded-lg
placeholder:text-gray-300
focus:border-white focus:bg-gray-800

bg-green-500 text-white text-xl font-bold 
hover:bg-green-400 hover:shadow-lg hover:shadow-green-500/20
active:scale-95 transition-all
9. GLOBAL OVERRIDE (if needed)
Add this CSS to force all text to be readable:
css/* Force all text in the form to be visible */
.equipment-form * {
  color: white !important;
}
.equipment-form input::placeholder,
.equipment-form textarea::placeholder {
  color: rgb(209 213 219) !important; /* gray-300 */
}
10. ACCESSIBILITY BONUS

Add aria-label attributes to all inputs
Increase line-height for better readability: leading-relaxed on all text
Add focus indicators: focus:ring-2 focus:ring-white focus:ring-offset-2

This will transform the form from barely visible gray-on-gray to a high-contrast, extremely readable interface that's perfect for users of all ages and vision abilities!
