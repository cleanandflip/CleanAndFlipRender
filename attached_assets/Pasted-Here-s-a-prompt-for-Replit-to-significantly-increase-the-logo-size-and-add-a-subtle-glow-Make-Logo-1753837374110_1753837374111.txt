Here's a prompt for Replit to significantly increase the logo size and add a subtle glow:

Make Logo Much Larger with Subtle Glow Effect
The "CF" logo is barely visible. It needs to be at least 2-3x larger and have a very subtle glow to make it stand out.
1. Navigation Bar - Make Logo 2x Larger with Glow:
The logo should be as tall as or slightly taller than the text height:
jsx// CURRENT: Too small (appears to be ~20px)
// NEW: Make it prominent (40px minimum) with subtle glow
<nav className="floating-nav">
  <Link href="/" className="flex items-center gap-3">
    <img 
      src="/path-to-logo" 
      alt="Clean & Flip Logo" 
      className="h-10 w-10 filter invert logo-glow"  // 40px x 40px
      style={{ minHeight: '40px', minWidth: '40px' }}
    />
    <span className="font-bold text-white text-lg">CLEAN & FLIP</span>
  </Link>
</nav>
2. Auth Page - Make Logo 3x Larger with Glow:
As the main focal point, it needs to be much more prominent:
jsx// CURRENT: Too small (appears to be ~30-40px)  
// NEW: Make it a proper focal point (80-100px)
<div className="flex justify-center mb-8">
  <img 
    src="/path-to-logo" 
    alt="Clean & Flip" 
    className="h-20 w-20 filter invert logo-glow-large"  // 80px x 80px
    style={{ minHeight: '80px', minWidth: '80px' }}
  />
</div>
3. Add Subtle Glow CSS:
Create a very subtle, professional glow effect:
css/* Subtle glow for navigation logo */
.logo-glow {
  filter: invert(1) drop-shadow(0 0 8px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3));
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

.logo-glow:hover {
  filter: invert(1) drop-shadow(0 0 12px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5));
}

/* Larger glow for auth page logo */
.logo-glow-large {
  filter: invert(1) drop-shadow(0 0 16px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4));
}

/* Alternative: Using box-shadow for a softer glow */
.logo-container {
  position: relative;
}

.logo-container::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  width: 120%;
  height: 120%;
  background: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(255,255,255,0.15) 0%, transparent 70%);
  z-index: -1;
  filter: blur(10px);
}
4. Size Comparison Guide:
Navigation Logo:
- Current: ~20px (too small)
- New: 40px (2x larger, matches text height)

Auth Page Logo:  
- Current: ~30-40px (too small as focal point)
- New: 80px (2-3x larger, proper focal element)

Footer Logo (if exists):
- Current: ~16px
- New: 32px
5. Mobile Responsive Sizes:
css@media (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Slightly smaller on mobile but still prominent */
  .nav-logo {
    height: 32px !important;
    width: 32px !important;
  }
  
  .auth-logo {
    height: 64px !important;
    width: 64px !important;
  }
}
6. Testing the Glow Effect:

The glow should be visible but not overwhelming
It should make the logo "pop" against the dark background
Test on different screen brightnesses
Ensure it doesn't look like a loading indicator

Result:

Logo clearly visible and properly sized (2-3x current size)
Subtle white glow makes it stand out without being distracting
Professional appearance that enhances the brand
Consistent sizing and glow effect throughout the site

Please implement these changes to make the logo a proper focal point with an elegant glow effect.
