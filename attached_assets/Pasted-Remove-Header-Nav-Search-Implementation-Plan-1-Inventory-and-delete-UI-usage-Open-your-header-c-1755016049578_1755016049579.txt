Remove Header (Nav) Search — Implementation Plan
1) Inventory and delete UI usage
Open your header component (e.g., src/components/layout/Header.tsx or similar).

Remove any <SearchBar />, <HeaderSearch />, or custom search input JSX in the header.

Remove icons/buttons that only existed to submit/clear header search.

Adjust flex/grid spacing so the header layout remains balanced.

Grep to find all header-search usage

nginx
Copy
Edit
rg -n "HeaderSearch|SearchBar|nav search|header search|onHeaderSearch|searchHotkey"
2) Remove header-specific logic/state
Delete any local state, refs, or effects related to header search:

const [headerQuery, setHeaderQuery] = useState(...)

useEffect syncing q to URL from the header

Debounce timers specific to header search

Remove header-only handlers:

onHeaderSearchChange

onHeaderSearchSubmit

focusHeaderSearch()

3) Kill global hotkeys that targeted header search
Remove global / hotkey that focused the header input.

If you still want / to focus search on the /products page, bind it inside the products page only.

nginx
Copy
Edit
rg -n "keydown|hotkey|keyCode|event\.key.*\/"
4) Remove header search wiring in routing/services
If you added a shared searchService earlier, keep it for the page search; just remove any header subscriber/focus logic.

Delete header-specific analytics events such as header_search_used.

Ensure no code tries to navigate to /products on Enter from the header (it no longer exists).

5) Delete dead files (only if header-exclusive)
If you had a header-only component, delete it:

src/components/search/HeaderSearch.tsx

src/components/layout/HeaderSearchInput.tsx

Remove any header-only CSS/modules.

Update barrel exports that referenced these files.

Confirm no more references

nginx
Copy
Edit
rg -n "HeaderSearch|headerSearch|SearchInHeader"
Expect no matches in /src.

6) Update layout spacing and a11y
Replace the removed search with either:

Nothing (tighten spacing), or

A simple “Shop” link emphasis (since search moved to /products).

Re-check tab order (no dead tab stops where the input used to be).

Ensure header landmarks still make sense (<nav>, site logo link, etc.).

7) Tests & analytics
Delete/update tests that mounted header search.

Remove any dashboards/metrics relying on header search events.

Grep for tests

bash
Copy
Edit
rg -n "header search|HeaderSearch|search in header" test src
8) QA checklist
Header loads with no console errors/warnings.

No focusable ghost element where the search was.

Pressing / does nothing globally (unless on /products where you decide to focus that page’s search).

On /products, the page search still works perfectly (type → URL ?q= updates; results filter).

Old header search code is gone from the bundle (check build size or grep).

9) Rollback (if needed)
Keep the removal in a feature branch (chore/remove-header-search).

If you regret it, revert that PR and reinsert the header search component; no other systems depend on it now.

Optional (recommended)
Add a small “Search” CTA in the header that navigates to /products and focuses the page search (no input in the header):

Make the header button/link route to /products.

On /products mount, if a ?focus=search flag exists, focus the page search input once, then remove the param. (No styling provided here—theme handles the look.)

If you want, I’ll write the tiny “focus on arrival” hook for the products page and the minimal link behavior to replace the old header input.
