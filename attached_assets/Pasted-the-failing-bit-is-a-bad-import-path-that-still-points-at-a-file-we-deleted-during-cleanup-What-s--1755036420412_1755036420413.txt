the failing bit is a bad import path that still points at a file we deleted during cleanup.

[vite] Failed to resolve import "./admin/observability-complete" from client/src/pages/admin.tsx
observability-complete.tsx no longer exists. Our canonical page is now client/src/pages/observability.tsx (or whatever path you placed it in from my last message).

Fast fix (do this now)
1) Update the import in client/src/pages/admin.tsx
Replace:

ts
Copy
Edit
import ObservabilityPage from "./admin/observability-complete";
with:

ts
Copy
Edit
// If the merged page sits beside admin.tsx:
import ObservabilityPage from "./observability";

// If you placed it under an admin folder:
import ObservabilityPage from "./admin/observability";

// If you put it under a feature dir, use the correct relative path, e.g.:
// import ObservabilityPage from "../observability/ObservabilityPage";
2) (Optional safety shim) Add a re-export to avoid future breakage
If other files still import the old path, add a tiny shim so nothing breaks while you refactor imports:

Create client/src/pages/admin/observability-complete.tsx:

tsx
Copy
Edit
// Temporary shim: re-export canonical page
export { default } from "../observability"; // adjust if your canonical file lives elsewhere
Then remove this shim once rg shows no references to observability-complete.

3) One-liner to fix any remaining stale imports
From repo root:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Replace old path with canonical import (adjust target on the right if needed)
rg -l '["\']\.\/admin\/observability-complete["\']' client/src \
 | xargs -I{} sed -i 's#\./admin/observability-complete#\./observability#g' {}
About those “Sanitization check / Skipping sanitization” lines
Those are info logs from your request-sanitizer middleware. They indicate endpoints that are whitelisted (e.g., /user, /cart, /track-activity) and therefore bypass sanitization. They are not errors. If you want quieter logs, lower the log level or gate those messages behind NODE_ENV !== "production".

Quick health checks after the change
Type-check / dev

pnpm tsc --noEmit

Admin page loads
Open your Admin dashboard and switch to the Observability tab. The Vite error should be gone.

Replit cleanup instruction (continue the de-dupe plan)
Keep only:

client/src/pages/observability.tsx

client/src/api/observability.ts

server/src/routes/observability.ts (or your server path)

client/src/components/ui/Dropdown.tsx

Remove all other observability* and observability-* files.

Run the duplicate finder + cleanup scripts I provided previously to catch any other “one feature, many files” conflicts, then re-run typecheck.
