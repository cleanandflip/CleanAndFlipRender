Here's a prompt for Replit to remove the unnecessary branding:

Remove Redundant Branding from Auth Page
The auth page has too much duplicate branding that takes up unnecessary space. Please clean it up.
Remove These Elements:
1. Remove the Circled Section:
Delete the entire section that contains:

The second "CLEAN & FLIP" logo
"JOIN THE MARKETPLACE" heading
"Turn unused gear into cash, buy quality equipment you can trust" text

This is redundant since the logo is already in the navigation bar.
2. Remove or Minimize Right Sidebar (on auth pages only):
The right side section with:

"TRUSTED MARKETPLACE"
Icon sections (Verified Quality, Expert Knowledge, Fair Pricing)
Marketing copy

Options:

Option A: Remove entirely on auth pages
Option B: Show only on desktop, hide on mobile/tablet
Option C: Replace with a simple tagline

3. Simplified Auth Layout:
jsx// Clean auth page layout
<div className="auth-page">
  {/* Navigation stays as is */}
  <nav>...</nav>
  
  {/* Centered auth form only */}
  <div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
    <div className="auth-form-container max-w-md w-full">
      <h2>Create Account</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-400 mb-6">
        Join Clean & Flip to buy and sell equipment
      </p>
      
      <form>
        {/* Form fields */}
      </form>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
4. Keep Only Essential Elements:

Navigation bar with logo (top)
Auth form (centered)
Small security/legal links at bottom
Remove ALL duplicate branding

5. Mobile Considerations:
On mobile, the auth form should:

Take up full width (with padding)
No sidebars
No marketing content
Just logo in nav + form

6. If You Must Keep Some Branding:
Add a single subtle line under the form:
jsx<p className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-8">
  The trusted marketplace for weightlifting equipment
</p>
Result Should Be:

Clean, minimal auth page
No duplicate logos
No marketing sidebars on auth pages
Form is the primary focus
Professional and uncluttered

The auth pages should be focused solely on getting users to complete registration/login without distractions.
