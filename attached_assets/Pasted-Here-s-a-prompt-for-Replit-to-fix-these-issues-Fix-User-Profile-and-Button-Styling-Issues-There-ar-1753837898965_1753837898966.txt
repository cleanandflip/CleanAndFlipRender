Here's a prompt for Replit to fix these issues:

Fix User Profile and Button Styling Issues
There are several bugs that need to be fixed:
1. Address Not Saving on Sign Up
When users sign up and enter their address, it's not being saved to their profile.
Fix needed:

Check the registration/signup handler
Ensure the address fields (street address and city/state/zip) are being saved to the database
Verify the user creation query includes address fields

javascript// In the signup handler, make sure to save:
const newUser = {
  // ... other fields
  address: formData.address,
  city_state_zip: formData.cityStateZip,
  // ... 
}
2. Remove Case Sensitivity from Address Fields
Address fields should NOT be case sensitive.
Fix needed:

Remove any case-sensitive validation on address fields
Store addresses as entered (don't force uppercase/lowercase)
When comparing addresses (for local verification), use case-insensitive comparison

javascript// BAD: Case sensitive
if (cityStateZip === "Asheville, NC 28806") 

// GOOD: Case insensitive
if (cityStateZip.toLowerCase().includes("asheville") && 
    cityStateZip.toUpperCase().includes("NC"))

// For ZIP validation, extract numbers which aren't case-sensitive
const zipCode = cityStateZip.match(/\d{5}/)?.[0];
Also check these fields for case sensitivity and fix:

Email (should be case-insensitive for login)
City names
State abbreviations (accept "nc" or "NC")

3. Fix Button Color Inconsistency
Some buttons are showing as black instead of the blue theme.
Current issues visible:

"Add Address" button in saved addresses section is black
Buttons should be using the consistent blue theme color

Fix needed:
css/* Ensure ALL buttons use the primary button style */
.btn-primary,
button[type="submit"],
.button-primary {
  background-color: #60A5FA !important; /* Light blue */
  color: white !important;
  border: none;
  transition: all 0.2s;
}

.btn-primary:hover {
  background-color: #3B82F6 !important; /* Darker blue on hover */
}

/* Remove any conflicting black button styles */
.btn-black,
.button-dark {
  /* Delete or override these */
}
Check these locations:

"Browse Products" button
"Add New Address" button
"Add Address" button
"View All Orders" link (should this be a button?)
Any form submit buttons

4. Verify Data Flow
Ensure the address is properly flowing from signup → database → user profile:
javascript// 1. Signup form should include
<input name="address" required />
<input name="cityStateZip" required />

// 2. API should save
await db.users.create({
  // ... other fields
  address: req.body.address,
  city_state_zip: req.body.cityStateZip
})

// 3. Profile should display
const userAddress = user.address || "No address saved";
const cityStateZip = user.city_state_zip || "";
5. Additional Fixes

Make email case-insensitive for login (store lowercase, compare lowercase)
Ensure all form validations are user-friendly (not overly strict)
Test that saved addresses show up after adding them

Please fix these issues to ensure proper data saving and consistent styling throughout the application.
