ðŸš€ REPLIT IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT
CRITICAL: Execute this complete dashboard overhaul WITHOUT stopping until 100% functional:
YOUR MISSION:
Transform the Clean & Flip Developer Dashboard from broken prototype to professional e-commerce admin panel. Every tab is currently broken - fix ALL issues systematically.
EXECUTE IN ORDER:
1. DATABASE FIXES (PRIORITY 1)

Fix equipment_submissions table - add missing reference_number column
Fix analytics tracking - ensure activity_logs captures all events
Fix category product counts - they all show 0
Add proper indexes for performance

2. BACKEND REPAIRS

Fix ALL /api/admin/* endpoints returning empty/zero data
Implement real analytics data collection
Fix Stripe integration to actually sync products
Add request caching/deduplication to stop API spam
Enable Redis caching (currently showing disabled)

3. COMPLETE UI OVERHAUL

REMOVE ALL WHITE BACKGROUNDS - enforce dark theme everywhere
Make ALL tabs consistent: bg-gray-800/50, border-gray-700, proper spacing
Fix Product Edit Modal - currently white, should be dark themed
Rebuild Users tab - currently basic and broken
Fix Submissions tab - infinite loading error
Fix Analytics tab - shows $0 for everything
Fix Wishlist Analytics - completely empty

4. IMPLEMENT PROFESSIONAL FEATURES

Real-time WebSocket updates
Working charts with actual data (use Recharts)
Bulk operations on all tables
Advanced filtering/search on every tab
Export functionality (CSV/PDF)
Proper loading states and error handling
Mobile responsive design

5. CRITICAL FUNCTIONALITY
Every button must work. Every stat must show real data. Every chart must display actual metrics. No placeholders. No "coming soon". No broken modals.
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
âœ… Zero console errors
âœ… All metrics show real data
âœ… Consistent dark theme (no white elements)
âœ… All CRUD operations functional
âœ… <500ms load time per tab
âœ… Mobile responsive
âœ… Professional UI matching Shopify/WooCommerce standards
DO NOT STOP UNTIL:

Equipment Submissions loads properly
Analytics shows actual revenue/orders/conversion data
Product Edit Modal is dark themed and saves correctly
Users tab shows real spending data and has filters
Categories show correct product counts
Wishlist Analytics displays real metrics
System tab shows accurate performance data
Stripe integration actually works

Start with database fixes, then backend, then frontend. Test everything. Make it production-ready. This is a professional e-commerce platform, not a demo.
BEGIN NOW. Complete systematically. Do not skip any issue.
