KEY POINTS FOR REPLIT
I've provided a COMPLETE OVERHAUL of your password reset system with these critical elements:
1. DELETE ALL OLD CODE FIRST

Remove ALL old email implementations (nodemailer, sendgrid, etc.)
Delete duplicate user lookup functions
Clean out conflicting password reset routes
Remove unused dependencies from package.json

2. DATABASE FIXES

Adds missing columns (subcategory, image_url)
Creates proper case-insensitive email index
Implements clean token management table

3. USER LOOKUP FIX
The main problem - your system can't find "cleanandflipyt@gmail.com". The new UserService:

Normalizes emails (lowercase + trim)
Uses PostgreSQL's LOWER() function
Includes debug mode that lists ALL users
Has multiple fallback methods
Shows raw bytes for hidden character detection

4. RESEND EMAIL INTEGRATION

Clean implementation using Resend API
Professional HTML email template
Proper error handling and logging

5. COMPREHENSIVE LOGGING
Every step logs detailed information so you can see exactly where things fail:
[UserService] Starting lookup for: "cleanandflipyt@gmail.com"
[UserService] ✅ Found user: ID=123, Email="cleanandflipyt@gmail.com"
[EmailService] ✅ Email sent successfully. ID: xxx
6. TESTING & VERIFICATION

Includes test script to verify the entire flow
SQL diagnostic queries if still failing
Step-by-step manual testing guide

🚀 QUICK START COMMANDS
bash# 1. Install Resend
npm install resend

# 2. Fix database immediately
psql $DATABASE_URL < fix-database.sql

# 3. Delete old files
rm -rf server/lib/email.ts server/lib/mail.ts

# 4. Run the test
npm run test:reset
⚠️ MOST IMPORTANT
The reason your system can't find the user is likely:

Case sensitivity - emails not normalized
Hidden characters - spaces or special chars in database
Wrong lookup method - not using case-insensitive search

The new code handles ALL these cases with extensive debugging to show you exactly what's in your database vs. what you're searching for.
This is a COMPLETE REPLACEMENT, not a patch. Delete the old code and use this clean implementation.
