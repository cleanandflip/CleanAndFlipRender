Summary for Replit Implementation
I've created a comprehensive instruction document that addresses both your critical issues:
Key Problems Identified:

Password Reset Failure: The system can't find "cleanandflipyt@gmail.com" despite it being an active user - this is likely due to case sensitivity issues or improper email normalization
Database Schema Mismatch: Missing columns (products.subcategory, categories.image_url) causing query failures

The Solution Provides:
1. Database Fixes:

SQL commands to add missing columns immediately
Proper schema updates for Drizzle ORM
New password_reset_tokens table for secure token management

2. Complete Password Reset System:

Robust User Lookup: Case-insensitive email matching with proper normalization
Token Management: Secure token generation with expiration
Email Service: Professional HTML email templates using Nodemailer
Security: Prevents email enumeration attacks, invalidates old tokens

3. Full Implementation Stack:

Backend services with proper error handling
API routes with validation
Frontend components (Request Reset & Reset Password pages)
Testing scripts to verify everything works

Critical Implementation Notes:

Email Normalization: All emails are converted to lowercase and trimmed before database operations
Security First: The system always returns success messages to prevent user enumeration
Token Expiration: 1-hour expiration with automatic invalidation of old tokens
Database Indexes: Proper indexing for performance on lookup operations

Quick Start Commands for Replit:
bash# Fix database immediately
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subcategory VARCHAR(255);"
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "ALTER TABLE categories ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS image_url TEXT;"

# Install required packages
npm install nodemailer @types/nodemailer

# Run migrations
npm run db:generate && npm run db:migrate
Testing the Fix:
The document includes testing scripts that will:

Verify all users are findable
Test the complete password reset flow
Validate database schema integrity

This solution transforms your basic password reset into a production-ready system with proper security, error handling, and user experience. The case-insensitive email lookup will fix your immediate issue with finding users, while the schema fixes will resolve all database query errors.
