fix onboarding + address sync end-to-end, purge old code, and wire the cart/checkout to the new SSOT system. It’s written so you can paste it right into your task tracker.

🔧 Replit: Rebuild & Wire Up SSOT Address + Onboarding (Miles, Local checks) — Purge Legacy
0) TL;DR outcomes we need
ONE source of truth for addresses: addresses table (+ users.profile_address_id pointer).
No other address fields anywhere.

Onboarding uses the SSOT: Step saves address → marks user as onboarded → redirects correctly.

Miles, not km. Local radius = 50 miles.

Geoapify autocomplete fills the form and saves the canonicalized address.

Cart/Checkout gates by “has default address?” and Local-only product rules.

Profile/Dashboard “Addresses” tab rebuilt to new components (no legacy UI).

All legacy code/queries that reference users.street, users.zip_code, etc. are deleted and not imported.

Observability 400 spam removed.

DB user wipe utility + test accounts flow.

1) Hard purge of legacy address/onboarding code
1.1 Remove legacy columns from code (not DB migrations here)
Search and delete/replace any usage of these identifiers in server & client:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
users.street
users.city
users.state
users.zip_code
users.latitude
users.longitude
zipCode
street (when meant to be address line 1)
Keep only SSOT keys: street1, street2, city, state, postal_code, country, latitude, longitude, geoapify_place_id, is_default, is_local.

Commands (run from repo root) to find offenders:

perl
Copy
Edit
rg -n --hidden --glob '!node_modules' -e '\busers\.(street|city|state|zip_code|latitude|longitude)\b'
rg -n --hidden --glob '!node_modules' -e '\bzipCode\b'
rg -n --hidden --glob '!node_modules' -e '\bstreet\b' server client | rg -v 'street1|street2'
Delete or refactor any matches.

1.2 Delete legacy files/blocks (examples based on prior notes)
client/src/pages/checkout_broken.tsx (remove file + imports)

Any legacy onboarding components not in client/src/pages/onboarding/* (delete them)

Legacy address routes still sitting in server/routes.ts (remove entire blocks for /api/addresses and legacy profile endpoints)

Any old dashboard/address widgets not under client/src/components/addresses/* (remove file + references)

1.3 Ensure dashboard addresses tab uses the new components
In client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx or wherever the Addresses tab renders, replace the panel with:

components/addresses/AddressList

a modal that mounts components/addresses/AddressForm

Remove any older “Add Address” UI and imports.

2) Fix the login error referencing legacy columns
Logs show:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
Error getting user by email: column "street" does not exist
Action:

Open server/storage.ts → getUserByEmail (and any similar queries).
Remove any SELECT users.street, users.zip_code, ....

If we need address in that query, JOIN the SSOT:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT u.*, a.id AS profile_address_id, a.street1, a.street2, a.city, a.state, a.postal_code, 
       a.country, a.latitude, a.longitude, a.is_local
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN addresses a ON a.id = u.profile_address_id
WHERE LOWER(u.email) = LOWER($1)
Re-run login to confirm no 42703 errors.

3) Server: SSOT & “onboarded” gate
3.1 “Onboarded” definition
A user is considered onboarded if:

users.profile_address_id IS NOT NULL and a matching address exists.

Optionally users.profile_complete = TRUE if that flag exists.

Create a helper in server/lib/userOnboarding.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
export function isUserOnboarded(u: { profile_address_id?: string | null; profile_complete?: boolean | null }) {
  return Boolean(u?.profile_address_id); // keep simple: pointer present === onboarded
}
3.2 Update /api/user response
Always include profileAddress by joining addresses via profile_address_id.

Add onboarded: boolean using the helper above.

3.3 Cart/Checkout gate middleware (server-side)
Replace any legacy gate with a new requireOnboarded middleware:

ts
Copy
Edit
export function requireOnboarded(req, res, next) {
  if (!req.isAuthenticated?.() || !req.user) return res.status(401).json({error:'Unauthenticated'});
  if (!isUserOnboarded(req.user)) return res.status(428).json({error:'Profile incomplete', redirect:'/onboarding?from=cart'});
  next();
}
Apply to cart/checkout POST routes that require a shipping address.

Note: Don’t gate simple GET reads of cart (that’s why we saw GET /api/cart 200). Gate when doing actions that require address.

4) Miles + Local detection (50 miles)
4.1 Server util (replace km with miles)
In server/lib/addressCanonicalizer.ts (or new distance.ts):

ts
Copy
Edit
const EARTH_RADIUS_MILES = 3958.7613;

export function haversineMiles(a: {lat:number, lon:number}, b: {lat:number, lon:number}) {
  const toRad = (v:number)=> v*Math.PI/180;
  const dLat = toRad(b.lat - a.lat);
  const dLon = toRad(b.lon - a.lon);
  const lat1 = toRad(a.lat);
  const lat2 = toRad(b.lat);
  const h = Math.sin(dLat/2)**2 + Math.cos(lat1)*Math.cos(lat2)*Math.sin(dLon/2)**2;
  return 2 * EARTH_RADIUS_MILES * Math.asin(Math.sqrt(h));
}

export function isLocalMiles(user: {latitude:number, longitude:number}, warehouse: {latitude:number, longitude:number}, radiusMiles=50) {
  if (user.latitude == null || user.longitude == null) return false;
  return haversineMiles(
    {lat:user.latitude, lon:user.longitude},
    {lat:warehouse.latitude, lon:warehouse.longitude}
  ) <= radiusMiles;
}
Use this exclusively wherever is_local is computed/persisted.

4.2 Persist is_local
When creating/updating an address:

compute is_local in miles against warehouse coords from env:

WAREHOUSE_LAT, WAREHOUSE_LON

Save on the addresses row.

5) Geoapify autocomplete → form fill → save
5.1 Server proxy still OK, but handle 429
In /api/geocode/autocomplete:

Add debounce on client (300–400ms).

On 429, return 200 with { results: [], rateLimited: true } so UI can show: “Too many requests, slow down”.

Add simple per-IP rate limit (e.g., 10 req / 10s).

5.2 Client address-autocomplete.tsx
Ensure selection maps to fields:

street1 ← properties.address_line1 || properties.street

street2 ← empty

city ← properties.city || properties.town || properties.village

state ← properties.state_code || properties.state

postal_code ← properties.postcode

country ← properties.country_code?.toUpperCase() || 'US'

latitude/longitude from geometry.coordinates (GeoJSON lon,lat → swap to lat, lon)

geoapify_place_id ← properties.place_id

Ensure the UI sets these values into react-hook-form so the Save button posts a complete payload.

5.3 Form validation (client)
All required fields: firstName, lastName, street1, city, state, postal_code.

Phone step: use libphonenumber-js → block letters/single digit. Must be valid E.164 or national (US).

Remove SMS option entirely from UI.

6) Onboarding flow (client + server)
6.1 Pages (client)
GET /onboarding: index orchestrates steps.

Step 1: Address

Uses AddressForm. On Save:

POST /api/addresses (body includes is_default:true).

Then call POST /api/onboarding/complete with { addressId }.

On success: if from=cart → /cart; else /dashboard.

Step 2: Phone

Validate via libphonenumber-js.

Save via PUT /api/user (phone only).

Step 3: Summary

Show address + phone. “Complete Setup” triggers nothing else (already saved) — simply route away.

Important: Do not loop back to step 1. The “loop” bug is happening because the cart gate or onboarding check still reads legacy flags. Fix that via §3.

6.2 Server endpoints
POST /api/addresses (auth required)

Zod validates SSOT fields.

Computes is_local (miles).

If is_default:true, clear other defaults for user.

Returns the new address row.

POST /api/onboarding/complete

Body: { addressId: string }

Sets users.profile_address_id = addressId, profile_complete=true, onboarding_step=3, onboarding_completed_at=NOW().

Refresh session user so /api/user immediately reflects new state:

ts
Copy
Edit
const updated = await storage.getUserById(req.user.id);
req.login(updated, err => { if (err) return next(err); return res.json({ok:true}); });
GET /api/onboarding/status

Returns { onboarded, step, profileAddress? } based on SSOT.

7) Cart/Checkout wiring
7.1 Cart page (client)
When mounting, fetch /api/user.

If onboarded === false and cart action requires shipping (any shipping or local-only items), redirect to /onboarding?from=cart.

If onboarded === true, fetch GET /api/addresses?default=true.

Pre-fill checkout shipping with it.

Allow “Change” → open address selector (list) or new address modal (which upon save → also updates profile_address_id if “make default” checked).

7.2 Local-only product rules
Product model: ensure fields local_only:boolean, shipping_available:boolean.

Add to cart (server):

If product.local_only === true → require user.onboarded & is_local on user’s default address.
If not local → 400 { error:'LOCAL_ONLY_PRODUCT', message:'Only customers within 50 miles can buy this item.' }.

Checkout:

If all items are local-only → shipping method = Free Local Delivery (48 hours), cost $0, ETA banner.

Mixed cart: local-only must be combined with allowed shipping items only if user is local; otherwise block with a clear message.

8) Dashboard: Addresses tab (new UI only)
Replace the entire tab’s content with:

<AddressList /> rendering all addresses, badges: Default, Local (if is_local true).

Actions: Edit, Make default (PATCH address or PUT /api/user update profile_address_id), Delete (guard if it’s the last one; if deleting default, auto-promote the most recent).

“Add new address” opens <AddressForm />.

Ensure calls all go through client/src/api/addresses.ts (React Query keys: ['addresses'], ['addresses','default']).

9) Observability noise (400 spam)
Your logs show constant:

bash
Copy
Edit
POST /api/observability/errors 400
Short-circuit this endpoint to return 204 if no DSN/config:

ts
Copy
Edit
app.post('/api/observability/errors', (req,res)=> res.status(204).end());
Or guard it behind if (process.env.ERROR_DSN) { ... } else res.status(204).end().

10) Clean user data + test users
10.1 DB wipe script (development only)
Create server/scripts/clear-users-dev.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { db } from '../db';
await db.execute(`DELETE FROM addresses; DELETE FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%@test.local' OR email LIKE 'seed+%';`);
console.log('Dev users/addresses cleared');
process.exit(0);
Run:

arduino
Copy
Edit
tsx server/scripts/clear-users-dev.ts
10.2 Seed test accounts
Email/Password users: create 3 with random addresses (some within 50 miles, some > 50).

Google OAuth users: create 2 via normal Google flow; complete onboarding.

For each, verify:

After saving address in onboarding, /api/user shows onboarded:true, profileAddress populated.

Navigating to /cart does not bounce back to onboarding.

Dashboard → Addresses tab shows saved address, Default badge, Local badge where appropriate.

Checkout pre-fills with default address; “Change” works and updates values.

11) Acceptance test matrix (manual)
Address autocomplete fills all fields after selection (street1, city, state, postal, country).

Miles radius logic: address inside 50mi shows “Local Delivery Available” banner; outside does not.

Onboarding: Save address → immediate redirect (to /cart if from=cart) and no relaunch of onboarding.

Profile → Addresses tab: Add, edit, delete, make default; list reflects changes without refresh (React Query invalidations).

Cart rules:

Local-only item + non-local user → add to cart blocked with clear error.

Local user + local-only item → allowed; checkout shows “Free Local Delivery in 48h”.

Checkout page: default address preloaded; changing default changes checkout form instantly.

Phone step: rejects letters/single digit; requires valid phone.

No SMS option anywhere.

No legacy UI: No old address widgets, no old onboarding components.

Logs clean: no “column street does not exist”; no observability 400 spam.

12) Concrete code touchpoints (quick list)
Server

server/storage.ts: remove legacy columns from selects; join addresses where needed.

server/routes.ts: delete legacy address/profile endpoints; mount routes/addresses.ts, routes/onboarding.ts.

server/routes/addresses.ts: ensure is_local computed in miles on create/update.

server/routes/onboarding.ts: implement POST /complete to set profile_address_id and refresh session.

server/lib/addressCanonicalizer.ts or lib/distance.ts: use miles helpers (above).

server/auth.ts: after login, ensure user object contains profile_address_id so frontend sees onboarded.

server/index.ts: observability endpoint short-circuit.

Client

client/src/pages/onboarding/index.tsx + StepAddress.tsx, StepPhone.tsx, StepSummary.tsx: no SMS; correct redirects; call /api/onboarding/complete.

client/src/components/ui/address-autocomplete.tsx: correct field mapping; debounced queries; handle 429 gracefully.

client/src/components/addresses/AddressForm.tsx & AddressList.tsx: default toggling, badges, edit/delete; invalidations.

client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx: Addresses tab → new components only.

client/src/pages/cart.tsx / hooks/use-cart.tsx: gate by onboarded; no legacy checks.

client/src/pages/checkout.tsx: preload default address; “Change” to modal; guest flow when not signed in.

13) What to watch in the logs (and how to fix)
401 GET /api/user when not signed in — OK while anonymous.

“column street does not exist” — must be gone after §2.

429 Geoapify — confirm the UI shows rate-limit info (no 500s).

POST /api/observability/errors 400 — should stop after §9.

14) Copy for UI (consistent messaging)
Local banner on address form:
“Local Delivery Available — Addresses within 50 miles of our warehouse qualify for free delivery within 48 hours.”

Cart blocking message for local-only item:
“Local pickup/delivery only. This item is available within 50 miles of our location.”

Done Criteria (sign-off)
I can:

Sign up (email or Google), enter address via onboarding, and land in /cart without being bounced back.

See my saved address on Dashboard → Addresses (new UI), marked Default and Local if applicable.

Add a local-only product as a local user and see Free Local Delivery (48h) at checkout.

Be blocked adding a local-only product as a non-local user with a clear error.

Change my default address in the dashboard and see checkout prefill update immediately.

Observe no legacy errors and clean logs.

Please implement exactly as above and push a PR that includes:

the ripgrep screenshots (or logs) showing no remaining legacy references,

a short screencast of onboarding → cart,

and the test matrix results.
