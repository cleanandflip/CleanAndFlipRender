Based on your comprehensive codebase audit, here's what you need to finish for a complete production deployment:
üö® CRITICAL - Must Fix Before Launch
1. Security Gaps

build/
*.log
.DS_Store
coverage/
.replit
.cache
3. Error Boundaries
tsx// Create: client/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx
// The audit shows this is recommended but doesn't exist
// Wrap your App component to catch React errors

‚úÖ QUICK WINS - Do These First

Fix .gitignore (2 minutes)
Add favicon and meta tags (10 minutes)
Create error boundary (30 minutes)
Add CSP headers (1 hour)
Test Stripe webhooks (30 minutes)

üéØ Minimum Viable Launch
If you want to launch ASAP, the absolute minimum you need:

‚úÖ Security: CSP headers + input sanitization
‚úÖ Legal: Privacy policy + terms of service
‚úÖ Checkout: Order confirmation emails
‚úÖ Error Handling: Global error boundary
‚úÖ .gitignore: Protect your secrets

üìä Your Current Status

Core Functionality: 95% complete
Security: 70% complete (needs CSP, sanitization)
Legal Compliance: 40% complete (missing GDPR features)
Testing: 0% complete
User Experience: 85% complete

Estimated time to 100% production ready:

Minimum launch: 1-2 days
Full feature complete: 1-2 weeks

The good news: Your core systems are solid! These are mostly finishing touches and compliance requirements. Focus on security and legal first, then enhance UX.
