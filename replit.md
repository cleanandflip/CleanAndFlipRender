## Overview

Clean & Flip is a weightlifting equipment exchange platform built as a full-stack web application. The system enables users to buy and sell gym equipment with features including product catalog management, user authentication, shopping cart functionality, order processing, and administrative tools. The application follows a single-seller model where the admin manages inventory and processes equipment submissions from users.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client-side application is built with React 18 using TypeScript and leverages modern React patterns:
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state with custom hooks for cart and authentication
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui design system and comprehensive unified admin dashboard with consistent theming across all components including AdminLayout, UnifiedMetricCard, UnifiedDataTable, and UnifiedButton
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming and scrollbar-hide utility for clean dropdown appearance
- **Build System**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for enhanced dropdown animations and transitions with portal-based rendering

The frontend implements lazy loading for non-critical pages, error boundaries for graceful error handling, and a responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences.

### Backend Architecture
The server-side follows a layered REST API architecture built with Node.js:
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for API endpoints
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with session-based authentication using bcrypt for password hashing
- **Security**: Comprehensive security middleware including rate limiting, input validation, and CORS protection
- **File Processing**: Multer for handling image uploads with Cloudinary integration for storage
- **Performance**: Request consolidation, caching layer, and database connection pooling

The API implements proper error handling, request validation using Zod schemas, and structured logging for monitoring and debugging.

### Data Storage Solutions
The application uses PostgreSQL as the primary database with the following key design decisions:
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL for scalability and managed hosting
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema versioning
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized connection pool configuration for performance
- **Full-Text Search**: PostgreSQL tsvector for advanced product search functionality
- **Session Storage**: Database-backed session storage for authentication persistence

Key tables include users, products, categories, orders, cart items, and equipment submissions with proper foreign key relationships and indexes.

### Authentication and Authorization
Multi-layered security approach with role-based access control:
- **User Authentication**: Session-based auth with Passport.js local strategy
- **Password Security**: bcrypt with industry-standard salt rounds (12)
- **Role Management**: Admin, developer, and user roles with middleware-enforced permissions
- **Rate Limiting**: Tiered rate limiting (general API, auth endpoints, admin operations)
- **Password Reset**: Secure token-based password recovery with email delivery
- **Session Management**: Secure session configuration with proper cookie settings

The system implements proper security headers, input sanitization, and SQL injection prevention.

## External Dependencies

### Payment Processing
- **Stripe**: Complete payment processing integration including Products API, Prices API, and checkout sessions
- **Webhook Handling**: Automated synchronization between internal catalog and Stripe product data

### Cloud Services
- **Cloudinary**: Image storage and transformation for product photos with upload optimization
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Alternative file storage option with proper service account authentication

### Database and Infrastructure
- **Replit Database**: Managed PostgreSQL database with automatic provisioning and secure environment variable integration
- **Redis** (Optional): Caching layer for improved performance with graceful degradation when unavailable

### Email Services
- **Resend**: Transactional email delivery for password resets, order confirmations, and system notifications
- **SendGrid**: Alternative email provider with comprehensive templating system

### Development and Build Tools
- **ESBuild**: Production build system for server-side code with optimized bundling
- **TypeScript**: Full-stack type safety with shared schemas between client and server
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migration management and schema introspection tools

The application is designed to be deployed on cloud platforms like Google Cloud Run with proper health checks, graceful shutdown handling, and environment-specific configurations.
