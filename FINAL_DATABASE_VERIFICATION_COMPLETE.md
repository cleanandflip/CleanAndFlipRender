üß™ Step J: Production Smoke Tests
----------------------------------
  Test 1: Column accessibility...
    ‚úÖ Critical columns accessible
  Test 2: Authentication query compatibility...
    ‚úÖ Authentication queries compatible
  Test 3: Cart constraint verification...
    ‚úÖ Cart uniqueness constraints present
      - uniq_owner_product

üéØ Production Verification Results:
===================================
‚úÖ Database connection operational
‚úÖ Schema compatibility verified
‚úÖ Authentication queries functional
‚úÖ Production deployment ready
```

## Error Resolution Summary

### ‚úÖ ELIMINATED: ERROR 42703 Issues
**Before**: `column "onboarding_step" does not exist`
**After**: Clean startup logs without any column errors

### ‚úÖ ELIMINATED: Schema Mismatch Problems
