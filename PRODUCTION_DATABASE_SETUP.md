# Production Database Setup - Clean & Flip

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

The production database setup has been successfully implemented with complete adaptation for the simplified role system (user/developer only).

### 🏗️ Architecture Created

**Core Configuration Files:**
- `server/config/database.ts` - Environment-aware database connections
- `server/config/environment.ts` - Environment detection and validation
- `server/config/security.ts` - Security configuration and validation
- `server/db/index.ts` - Database connection management

**Database Management Scripts:**
- `scripts/database/init-production.ts` - Production database initialization
- `scripts/database/init-development.ts` - Development database initialization  
- `scripts/database/verify.ts` - Database health verification
- `scripts/database/migrate.ts` - Schema migration management
- `scripts/database/seed-dev.ts` - Development test data seeding
- `scripts/database/backup.ts` - Production data backup

**Environment Utilities:**
- `scripts/utils/check-environment.ts` - Comprehensive environment validation
- `drizzle.config.prod.ts` - Production-specific Drizzle configuration

### 🔧 Key Features Implemented

**Role System Adaptation:**
- ✅ All scripts use "developer" role instead of "admin"
- ✅ Database initialization creates developer users, not admin users
- ✅ Complete removal of all admin/isAdmin references
- ✅ Preserved local customer detection (Asheville zip codes 28801-28818)

**Environment Safety:**
- ✅ Automatic environment detection (development/production)
- ✅ Database URL validation prevents dev database use in production
- ✅ Safety checks for "lingering-flower" vs production database hosts
- ✅ Comprehensive environment variable validation

**Database Management:**
- ✅ Dual database support (DATABASE_URL_DEV and DATABASE_URL_PROD)
- ✅ Retry logic and health checks for connections
- ✅ Performance indexes for production optimization
- ✅ Secure backup system excluding sensitive data

### 📋 Required Secrets Configuration

**For Production Deployment, add these to Replit Secrets:**

```bash
# Database Configuration (Required)
DATABASE_URL_PROD = [Your production Neon database URL]

# Security Configuration (Recommended)
SESSION_SECRET = [64-character random string]
JWT_SECRET = [64-character random string] 
ENCRYPTION_KEY = [32-character random string]

# Production Settings (Optional)
NODE_ENV = production
FORCE_SSL = true
```

**Note:** Developer credentials are automatically migrated from your development database - no additional secrets needed!

### 🚀 Usage Commands

**Environment Testing:**
```bash
tsx scripts/utils/check-environment.ts        # Verify all configurations
tsx scripts/database/verify.ts                # Test database connections
```

**Database Initialization:**
```bash
tsx scripts/database/init-development.ts      # Setup development database
tsx scripts/database/init-production.ts       # Setup production database
```

**Development Workflow:**
```bash
tsx scripts/database/seed-dev.ts              # Add test products and data
tsx scripts/database/migrate.ts               # Apply schema changes
```

**Complete Migration:**
```bash
tsx scripts/database/migrate-everything-to-production.ts  # Migrate ALL data to production
```

**Production Maintenance:**
```bash
tsx scripts/database/backup.ts                # Backup production data
```

### 🔍 Current Status

**✅ Development Database:**
- Environment: DEVELOPMENT  
- Host: ep-lingering-flower-afk8pi6o.c-2.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech
- Users: 2 (1 developer, 1 user)
- Categories: 3 
- Products: 13
- Role System: ✅ Verified (only user/developer roles)

**⚠️ Production Database:**
- Status: Not yet configured
- Requires: Only DATABASE_URL_PROD secret needed
- Ready: All scripts and configuration files created

### 🎯 Next Steps for Production Deployment

1. **Configure Production Database Secret:**
   - Add DATABASE_URL_PROD pointing to new Neon production database
   - Optionally add SESSION_SECRET for enhanced security

2. **Initialize and Migrate:**
   ```bash
   tsx scripts/database/init-production.ts                    # Setup production schema
   tsx scripts/database/migrate-everything-to-production.ts   # Copy all your data
   ```

3. **Deploy to Replit:**
   - Click Deploy button in Replit interface
   - Verify production environment detection
   - Test developer login with your existing credentials

### 🛡️ Security Features

- **Database Isolation:** Strict separation between dev/prod databases
- **Role Validation:** Only user/developer roles permitted system-wide
- **Environment Safety:** Multiple validation layers prevent configuration errors
- **Data Protection:** Backup system excludes passwords and payment data
- **Local Detection:** Preserved Asheville zip code customer identification

### 📊 System Verification

The verification script confirms:
- ✅ Role system properly configured (user/developer only)
- ✅ Local customer detection functional  
- ✅ Development database accessible and populated
- ✅ Zero admin/isAdmin references in entire codebase
- ✅ Build successful with no TypeScript errors

**Status:** Production database setup is complete and ready for deployment. All components have been adapted for the simplified role system while maintaining full functionality.
