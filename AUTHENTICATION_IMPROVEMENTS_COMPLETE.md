# Authentication and Logging Improvements - Complete

**Date:** August 18, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ ALL IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED

## 🎯 Changes Summary

### ✅ Guest-Safe User Endpoint  
- **Before:** `/api/user` returned scary 401 errors for guests
- **After:** Returns `200 {"auth": false, "user": null}` for guests
- **Benefit:** No more frightening error logs during normal browsing
- **Implementation:** New `authImprovements.guestSafeUser` middleware

### ✅ Smart 401 Logging
- **Before:** All 401s logged as WARN, creating noise for expected guest requests  
- **After:** Expected guest 401s logged as INFO, unexpected ones as WARN with details
- **Expected Paths:** `/api/user`, `/api/cart/add`, `/api/orders`, `/api/addresses`
- **Implementation:** `authImprovements.improvedAuthLogging` middleware

### ✅ Auth State Endpoint
- **New Endpoint:** `/api/auth/state` 
- **Purpose:** Explicit auth checking that never returns 401
- **Response:** `{"auth": true/false, "userId": "..."}` or `{"auth": false}`
- **Benefit:** Frontend can check auth status without error handling

### ✅ Frontend Query Improvements
- **Query Client:** Added smart retry logic that doesn't retry 4xx errors
- **Auth Hook:** Added `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` to prevent auth loops
- **Credentials:** All requests use `credentials: "include"` for proper cookie handling
- **Error Handling:** Better error boundaries for auth-related requests

### ✅ Detailed 401 Debugging
When unexpected 401s occur, logs now include:
- Path requested
- Cookie presence
- Session status  
- Authentication state
- Origin and referer headers
- User agent (truncated)

## 🛡️ Security & Cookie Configuration

### Production Cookie Settings ✅
- **Secure:** `true` (HTTPS only)
- **SameSite:** `"none"` (cross-origin support)
- **Domain:** Uses `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` for cleanandflip.com
- **HttpOnly:** `true` (XSS protection)

### Development Cookie Settings ✅  
- **Secure:** `false` (HTTP allowed)
- **SameSite:** `"lax"` (safer for local dev)
- **Domain:** `undefined` (host-only cookies)
- **HttpOnly:** `true` (XSS protection)
